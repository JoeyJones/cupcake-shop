      Here's a bit of history on Sophie's Cupcake Shop
    </h3>
    <p>
      My wife and I started the business after the recession hit us hard and we lost our jobs. One day we were at our community town hall and someone asked if we were
      the ones who brought in those cupcakes. She asked that she was looking for a place that sold those kind of delicious cupcakes and needed a few dozen for an event. 
      We replied that we made them at home. She was really surprised and said that she thought that they were made in a specailty bakery. She went ahead and ordered the few dozen cupcakes from  us and shall we say that the rest is history. We named this shop after my wifes mom.
